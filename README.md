Meets Specifications
Hi Udacious,
Congratulations! You nailed it this time üëè ‚ú®
You have met all the requirements for this project. I really appreciate the hard work you put into this project in particular, regarding implementing the interaction between country and page correctly, and also getting the correct p-values through all tests. üëå Keep up the great work and good luck with your upcoming project(s).

Code Quality
All code cells can be run without error.

Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.

Statistical Analyses
All results from different analyses are correctly interpreted.

In "Part II - A/B Test", student should correctly interpret the test statistic and p-value.
In "Part III - A regression approach", student should correctly analyze the interaction effects on all of p-value and statistical significance to predict conversions.
All statistical numeric values are calculated correctly.
Tip: Students can optionally attempt the classroom quizzes to ensure they are calculating the right value in many cases.

üü¢ Great work! In part III: 1(h), as you got the interaction between page and country correctly, however many learners tend to ignore it.

Conclusions should include both - statistical reasoning and practical reasoning for the situation.
